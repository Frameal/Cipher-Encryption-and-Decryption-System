# Cipher Encryption Project

A simple Java-based encryption system that demonstrates classic cipher algorithms and basic GUI handling.  
This project was made for **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

---

## Features
- Implements multiple cipher algorithms:
  - Vigenère Cipher
  - Bifid Cipher
  - Polybius Cipher
  - CipherX (custom cipher implementation)
- Central interface through `Home.java`
- Uses visual icons for an interactive interface
- Demonstrates string manipulation and GUI programming concepts

---

## Requirements
- **Java JDK 8 or higher**
- **Eclipse IDE with WindowBuilder plugin** (required to run or modify the GUI)

---

## How to Run

1. Install **Java JDK 8+** and ensure it is added to your system PATH.  
2. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE**.  
3. Make sure the **WindowBuilder** plugin is installed.  
   - In Eclipse, go to: `Help > Eclipse Marketplace > Search "WindowBuilder" > Install`
4. Compile and run the program:
   - Right-click on `Home.java` → **Run As** → **Java Application**
5. The main interface will appear and allow you to test different cipher algorithms.
